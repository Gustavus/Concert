Need a symlink to Web in doc_root/concert

ResponsiveFileManager is a submodule.
  Lives in Assets dir.
  Symlink to ResponsiveFilemanager/filemanager in Web
  Symlink to ResponsiveFilemanager/tinymce/plugins/responsivefilemanager in Assets/tinymce/js/tinymce/plugins

  need to init submodule when first cloned
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

  To update submodule
    Download production package
    remove everything from the master branch (except git stuff)
    Copy new package into master branch and commit with the version number
    Merge into Gustavus branch and fix any conflicts.
    Push to origin

  After pushing main Concert changes to Lisa, also need to run "git submodule update"

Tinymce
  Submodule
  Lives in Assets dir.

  need to init submodule when first cloned
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    Download package from site
    remove everything from the master branch (except git stuff)
    Copy new package into master branch and commit with the version number

    On update, make sure to fix skin css to have absolute paths from the doc_root
      This is only if tinymce is loaded through our minifier.
    Make sure symlink for tinymce/js/tinymce in Web/js/tinymce exists

    Make sure the symlink for ResponsiveFilemanager's plugin exists
      ln -s /cis/lib/Gustavus/Concert/Assets/ResponsiveFilemanager/tinymce/plugins/responsivefilemanager/ /cis/lib/Gustavus/Concert/Assets/tinymce_version/js/tinymce/plugins/responsivefilemanager

  After pushing main Concert changes to Lisa, also need to run "git submodule update"


fileTree
  Third party.
  I had to make a lot of updates to it though, so we might be in charge of maintaining our version.
  Symlink to fileTree in Web/js/






Todo:

Restrict copied files and new files using excluded dir. Also find a way to enforce template builder pages.

Add ability to merge old draft with current content. Or view changes.

Add new view to revisions for viewing a page?
